Self Driving Car Sandbox

## Summary

Use Unity 3d game engine to simulate car physics in a 3d world. 
Generate image steering pairs to train a neural network. Uses NVidia PilotNet NN topology.
Then validate the steering control by sending images to your neural network and feed steering back into the simulator to drive.

## Some videos to help you get started

### Training your first network

### Creating a robust training set

## Setup

You need to have [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) installed, and all python modules listed in the Requirements section below.

Linux Unity install [here](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/). Check last post in this thread.

You need python 3.4 or higher, 64 bit. You can create a virtual env if you like:
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
```

And then you can install the dependancies. This installs a specific version of keras only because it will allow you to load the pre-trained model with fewer problems. If not an issue for you, you can install the latest keras.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have an cuda supported GPU - probably NVidia
```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

Or without a supported gpu
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```


## Demo

1) Start the prediction server with the pre-trained model. 

```bash
cd sdsandbox/src
python predict_server.py ../outputs/highway.h5
```
 If you get a crash loading this model, you will not be able to run the demo. But you can still generate your own model. This is a problem between tensorflow/keras versions. 
 
2) Load the Unity project sdsandbox/sdsim in Unity. Double click on Assets/Scenes/main to open that scene.  

3) Hit the start button to launch. Then the "Use NN Steering".  


#To create your own data and train

## Generate training data

1) Load the Unity project sdsandbox/sdsim in Unity.  

2) Create a dir sdsandbox/sdsim/log.  

3) Hit the start arrow in Unity to launch project.  

4) Hit button "Generate Training Data" to generate image and steering training data. See sdsim/log for output files.  

5) Stop Unity sim by clicking run arrow again.  

6) Run this python script to prepare raw data for training:  

```bash
cd sdsandbox/src
python prepare_data.py
```

7) Repeat 4, 5, 6 until you have lots of training data.



## Train Neural network

```bash
python train.py ../outputs/mymodel.h5
```

Let this run. It may take a few hours if running on CPU. Usually far less on a GPU.



## Run car with NN

1) Start the prediction server. This listens for images and returns a steering result.  

```bash
python predict_server.py ../outputs/mymodel.h5
```

2) Start Unity project sdsim  

3) Push button "Use NN Steering"  



## Requirements
* [python 3.4+ 64 bit](https://www.python.org/)*
* [tensorflow-1+](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)  
* [keras-2+](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)   
* [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/)  
* [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)  
* [socketio](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-socketio)  
* [flask](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask)  
* [eventlet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eventlet)  
* [pyzmq](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq)  
* [pygame](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygame)**  
* [Unity 5.5+](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)  

*Note: May work with Python 2.7+. But you will need to train your own models. The stock models will not load.


**Note: pygame only needed if using mon_and_predict_server.py which gives a live camera feed during inferencing.
